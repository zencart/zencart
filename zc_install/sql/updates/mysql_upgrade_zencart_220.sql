############ IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS ###############
#
# * Zen Cart uses the zc_install/index.php program to do database upgrades
# * This SQL script is intended to be used by running zc_install
# * It is *not* recommended to simply run these statements manually via any other means
# * ie: not via phpMyAdmin or via the Install SQL Patch tool in Zen Cart admin
# * The zc_install program catches possible problems and also handles table-prefixes automatically
# *
# * To use the zc_install program to do your database upgrade:
# * a. Upload the NEWEST zc_install folder to your server
# * b. Surf to zc_install/index.php via your browser
# * c. On the System Inspection page, scroll to the bottom and click on Database Upgrade
# *    NOTE: do NOT click on the "Install" button, because that will erase your database.
# * d. On the Database Upgrade screen, you will be presented with a list of checkboxes for
# *    various Zen Cart versions, with the recommended upgrades already pre-selected.
# * e. Verify the checkboxes, then scroll down and enter your Zen Cart Admin username
# *    and password, and then click on the Upgrade button.
# * f. If any errors occur, you will be notified. Some warnings can be ignored.
# * g. When done, you will be taken to the Finished page.

#### VERSION UPDATE STATEMENTS
## THE FOLLOWING 2 SECTIONS SHOULD BE THE "LAST" ITEMS IN THE FILE, so that if the upgrade fails prematurely, the version info is not updated.
##The following updates the version HISTORY to store the prior version info (Essentially "moves" the prior version info from the "project_version" to "project_version_history" table
#NEXT_X_ROWS_AS_ONE_COMMAND:3
INSERT INTO project_version_history (project_version_key, project_version_major, project_version_minor, project_version_patch, project_version_date_applied, project_version_comment)
SELECT project_version_key, project_version_major, project_version_minor, project_version_patch1 as project_version_patch, project_version_date_applied, project_version_comment
FROM project_version;

## Now set to new version
UPDATE project_version SET project_version_major='2', project_version_minor='2.0', project_version_patch1='', project_version_patch1_source='', project_version_patch2='', project_version_patch2_source='', project_version_comment='Version Update 2.1.0->2.2.0', project_version_date_applied=now() WHERE project_version_key = 'Zen-Cart Main';
UPDATE project_version SET project_version_major='2', project_version_minor='2.0', project_version_patch1='', project_version_patch1_source='', project_version_patch2='', project_version_patch2_source='', project_version_comment='Version Update 2.1.0->2.2.0', project_version_date_applied=now() WHERE project_version_key = 'Zen-Cart Database';
