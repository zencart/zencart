Zen Cart&reg; - The Art of E-Commerce
===============

Zen Cart&reg; was the first Open Source e-Commerce web application to be fully PA-DSS Certified.

Zen Cart v2.0.0 is the latest major update to the project.  It contains bugfixes and updates for PHP8 applied on top of the PA-DSS Certified version v1.5.4.

Zen Cart is free and open source software, with free community-driven support available 24/7 on the Zen Cart&reg; Support Site forums at [zen-cart.com/forum](https://www.zen-cart.com/forum.php)

--------------------


Zen Cart&reg; v2.1.0-dev
---------------------

Compatibility
-------------
Zen Cart v2.1.0 is designed for:
 * PHP 8.0 to PHP 8.4
 * MySQL 5.7.8+ or MariaDB 10.2.7+
 * Apache 2.4
 
Refer to [compatibility requirements](https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/first_steps/server_requirements/) for additional details.


Installation
------------

Installation is simple:

1. [Download Zen Cart](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/releases)
2. Ensure you check that the md5/sha1 hash of the Zip matches those publicly posted.
  * The sha1 values for verifying the zip files hosted at Github are displayed on the [Zen Cart&reg; website](https://www.zen-cart.com/) along with [instructions on how to verify the file using the hash values](https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/installing/validate_sha/).
3. Unzip the downloaded zip file 
4. Everything inside the folder you unzipped needs to be uploaded to your webserver â€¦ for example, into your `public_html` or `www` or `html` folder (the folder will already exist on your webserver)
5. In your browser, enter the address to your site, such as: `www.example.com` (or if you uploaded it into another subdirectory such as `foldername` use `www.example.com/foldername`)
6. Rename the `/includes/dist-configure.php` and `/admin/includes/dist-configure.php` files to "`configure.php`" and make the files writable (so the install process can write your configuration information into them after you answer a few questions in the following steps).
7. Also make the `/cache` and `/logs` folders writable. (You will be prompted about making other folders writable during installation)
8. Follow the instructions that appear in your browser for installation. 

If some of the terms used in these brief instructions are things you don't understand, there is a much more detailed set of instructions in the [/docs/Implementation-Guide](https://www.zen-cart.com/docs/) PDF.
