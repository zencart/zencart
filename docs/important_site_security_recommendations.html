        <div>
            <h2>Leveraging Resources on the Zen Cart&reg; Website</h2>
            <p>
                The Zen Cart&reg; Team, along with Zen Cart&reg; Users and Contributors, regularly update security recommendations on the Zen Cart&reg; Website.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may wish to also consult recommendations posted on the <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/security/security_recommendations/">Zen Cart&reg; Website</a>. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>SSL Protection</h2>
            <p>
                A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is the standard security technology for establishing a secure and encrypted connection between a web server and a browser. This requires a SSL certificate from your web hosting provider or a third party certificate provider.    
            </p>
            <p>
                The preferred would be to have a dedicated SSL certificate but there may be additional expense involved in obtaining this. As a bare minimum, you should use a shared SSL certificate provided by your web hosting provider.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Accessing your Site Files Securely</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of using regular FTP to access your server files, it is advisable to use an FTP program that
                allows Secure FTP (SFTP or FTPS).

                This method will encrypt the information you transmit and receive. This is important especially when you
                are downloading database backups or configuration files which contain usernames and passwords, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your web hosting provider does not support Secure FTP, you may wish to consider a web hosting provider that takes security seriously.

            <div id="removeExtraFolders">
                <h2>Remove Extra Folders from your Server after Install</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        It is important that after you have installed your Zen Cart&reg; Store and are satisfied that it is working properly, including test transactions to test <em>ALL</em> the payment and shipping modules you are using.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        Remove the following folders and all the files inside them, to minimize security risks:
                        <li>/docs</li>
                        <li>/extras</li>
                        <li>/zc_install</li>
                        <li>/install.txt</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It is safe to keep these files on your <em>Local PC</em>, since they can be used as references/documentation, or used to aid in troubleshooting as diagnostic tools, or for upgrading/installing again in the future. However, those folders and files should <em>NOT</em> be on a live webserver.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        If you have no intentions of supporting downloadable products or music-media products, you can <em>optionally</em> also remove these folders:
                        <li>/download</li>
                        <li>/media</li>
                        <li>/pub</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        You will need to go to <em>Admin->Configuration->Attribute Settings->Enable Downloads</em>, and set it to <em>False</em> to turn off the warning message about the missing download folder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you choose to add downloadable products to your site or music-products, you will want to re-upload these appropriate folders (and their contents) to your server again, and assign appropriate permissions.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div> <!-- End removeExtraFolders //-->
            
            <div id="emailTransportMethod">
                <h2>Use "SMTPAUTH" or "SMTP" as your Email Transport Method Instead of the Generic "PHP" Setting</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Go to <em>Admin->Configuration->Email Options</em>, and change your Email Transport Protocol to <em>SMTPAUTH</em>, and then fill in the SMTP Credentials in the other settings lower on that same screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This will not only help prevent outgoing emails from ending up in spam folders, but will also prevent the disclosure of your admin foldername when sending emails from your admin screens.

                <h2>Set Configure.php Files as "Read Only"</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        It is important that you set permissions on the two configure.php files as Read Only.
                        Typically this means setting them to <em>"644"</em>, or in some cases <em>"444"</em>.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        The configure.php files are located in:
                        <li>/<em>&lt;YourStoreFolderName&gt;</em>/includes/configure.php</li>
                        <li>/<em>&lt;YourStoreFolderName&gt;</em>/<em>&lt;RenamedAdminFolderName&gt;</em>/includes/configure.php</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Quite often, setting permissions on a file to read only via FTP will not work. Even if the permission looks like it was set to read only, it really may not have been. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Verify the correct setting by accessing the store to see if there is a warning message on the top of the screen: "<span class='errorDetails'>Warning: I am able to write to the configuration file:...</span>". In such cases, you will need to use the "<em>File Manager</em>" supplied by your web hosting provider.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are using a Windows server, simply set the file as <em>"Read Only for Everyone"</em> and especially the <em>IUSR_xxxxx (Internet Guest Account)</em> user if running IIS, or the <em>"System Account"</em> or <em>"Apache User"</em> if running Apache.

                        It is wise to use complicated passwords so that a would-be hacker cannot easily guess them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can change your admin password in <em>Admin->Admin Access->Admin Users</em>, and click on the <em>"Reset Password"</em> button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We recommend that you use passwords that are at least 8 characters long.
                        Making them alpha-numeric (including letters, numbers, upper-and-lower-case, etc) helps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are going to use normal words, it is a good idea to join two words that do not normally go together.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Several folders, contain are <em>".htaccess"</em> files to prevent users from being able to browse through the files on your site unless they know exact filenames. Some also prevent access to "any" .PHP scripts, since it is expected that all PHP files in those folders will be accessed by other PHP files, and not by a browser directly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you delete these files, you run the risk of leaving yourself open to people snooping around.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        There are also some blank <em>index.html</em> files in several folders. 
                        <li>
                            These files are there to protect you in case your FTP software would not upload <em>".htaccess"</em> files, or your server would not accept them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            These only prevent directory browsing, and do not stop execution of .PHP files.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is a good "alternative", although using <em>.htaccess</em> files in all of these folders is the better choice for servers that accept these.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In order for the .htaccess settings supplied with Zen Cart&reg; to work, your web hosting provider must include either <em>"All"</em> or all of these: <em>"Limit Options Indexes"</em> parameters to the <em>"AllowOverride"</em> configuration in the server <em>apache/conf/httpd.conf</em> file. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If your web hosting provider does not allow setting the <em>"OPTIONS"</em> directive, you will need to leave that line out or put a <em>"#"</em> in front of it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If your web hosting provider does not allow you to create/use your own <em>.htaccess</em> files, they may provide an interface in your hosting control panel where you can set the desired <em>.htaccess</em> settings. 
                        Work with your web hosting provider to configure these settings if this is the method they require.

                        Your web hosting provider may use web serving software, such as <em>Nginx</em>, which do not use <em>.htaccess</em> files.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the case of <em>Nginx</em>, directives equivalent to the <em>.htaccess</em> rules are provided after installation of Zen Cart&reg; to serve as a start point.
                        These can be found in the "/<em>&lt;YourStoreFolderName&gt;</em>/zc_install/nginx_conf/" folder.

                    <p>
                        It is best to work with your web hosting provider to select and implement the best method for your specific server.

                <h2>Protect your "images" and other Folders</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        During initial installation, you are advised to set your images folder to <em>"Read/Write"</em>, so that you can use the Admin interface to upload product/category images without having to use FTP for each one. Similar recommendations are made to other files for various reasons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, leaving the images (or any other) folder in read/write mode means that hackers might be able to put malicious files in this (or other) folder(s) and thus create access points from which to attempt nasty exploits.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        Hence, once your site is built and your images have been created/loaded, you should increase the permission setting from <em>"Read/Write"</em> to <em>"Read Only"</em>.
                        <li>
                            On Linux/Unix hosts, permission setting recommendations for basic security are:
                            <ol class="noteList">
                                <li>

                                </li>
                                <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On Windows hosts, setting files as <em>"Read Only"</em> is usually sufficient.

                    <p>
                        If your site supports .htaccess protection, then you should use it for these folders. (The <em>".htaccess"</em> files included with v1.3.9 and newer should already cover the basics.)

                    <p>
                        If your business warrants, or you still want additional assurance (if running ther scripts outside of Zen Cart&reg;), hire a security consultant to audit your site regularly. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Check your Zen Cart <em>/cache/</em> folder for leftover files that do not belong there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Check your Zen Cart <em>/logs/</em> folder for <em>"myDebug-XXXXX.log"</em> files to see whether any errors are happening which need to be fixed. Delete the log files after you have addressed the errors.
