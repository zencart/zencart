Zen Cart(R) - The Art of E-Commerce
Welcome to Zen Cart(R) E-Commerce

THE FOLLOWING IS A VERY SIMPLIFIED INSTALLATION DOCUMENT.
WE SUGGEST YOU USE THE HTML VERSIONS IN THE /docs FOLDER FOR MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS.

THE README DOCUMENTS ARE IN THE /docs FOLDER OF THIS DISTRIBUTION.


You can find online documentation at: http://tutorials.zen-cart.com


Zen Cart has a built-in automatic installation system. However to use this you must first unpack
the code to a web server.

The web server can either be on your local computer or on an internet host.

To start off, you must extract the Zen Cart(R) ZIP file. How you do this depends on the operating system you use.

Once extracted, you will have a directory containing the Zen Cart(R) scripts.

The contents of this directory needs to be moved to your webserver, either by copying the directory or
by using an FTP progam.

You will then need to run the zc_install script.

To do this you must open a browser and type in the URL to your store:

If you are running the store on your own PC, this will be

   http://localhost/{zen-cart-directory}/zc_install/

or if on a live webserver:

   http://{www.mydomain.com}/zc_install/

Next you simply follow the prompts to install Zen Cart(R).

You will be asked for your MySQL database credentials. You must create the database and user+password prior to installation.

For more detailed installation instructions, please see the /docs/1.readme_installation.html document in this distribution.
