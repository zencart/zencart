<h1 class="intro center">What Is Zen Cart&reg;? </h1>
<div>
<h1>What &amp; History</h1>
<h3>Designed for Online Merchants</h3>
<p>Zen Cart&reg; <em>truly is</em> the art of e-commerce; a free, user-friendly, open source shopping cart system. The software is being developed by group of like-minded shop owners, programmers, designers, and consultants that think e-commerce could be and should be done differently. Some "solutions" seem to be complicated programming exercises instead of responding to users' needs, Zen Cart&reg; puts the merchant's and shopper's requirements first. Similarly, other programs are nearly impossible to install and use without an IT degree, Zen Cart&reg; can be installed and set-up by anyone with the most basic computer skills. Others are so expensive ... not Zen Cart&reg;, it's FREE! </p>
<h3>Designed for Online Shoppers</h3>
<p>Zen Cart&reg; is the first Open Source Ecommerce platform to attain PA-DSS certification.</p>
<p>Zen Cart&reg; delivers the ultimate online shopping experience to your customers. Navigating through your merchandise offerings is a breeze with Zen Cart&reg;, the program allows you to draw attention to products such as "featured" and "specials" etc in addition to the traditional category/product navigation. Once a product is added to the shopping cart, secure checkout is a simple 3-step process including collecting address information, shipping selection (multiple shipping methods including real-time internet shipping quotes are built-in), payment selection (PayPal&trade; and AuthorizeNet&trade; are just 2 of the various included modules) and confirming the final order including taxes and discounts/coupons/sales/gift-certificates applied. You are immediately notified of the order and your customer automatically receives an e-mail confirmation.</p>
<p>Zen Cart&reg;'s goals include:
<ul>
<li>make the program easy to set up</li>
<li>make it easy to customize</li>
<li>automate tasks, such as order confirmation</li> 
<li>make navigation simple </li>
<li>built in promotions; discount coupons, gift certificates, newsletters and product notification</li> 
<li>offer single item specials and storewide discounts, including group discounts and quantity discounts</li>
<li>built in intelligent Search Engine Optimization tools, including per-product metatag controls </li>
<li>password protected Administration Tool</li>
<li>support multiple languages, currencies and tax structures </li>
</ul>
In short, Zen Cart&reg; is shopping cart software the way it should have been all along.
</p>
<p>We simply want to deliver a fast and easy to use shopping cart program that's freely available to everyone under the GPL. Zen Cart's&reg; development team encourages feedback and contributions from the community and we invite open discussion about e-commerce solutions.</p>
<h3>For Web Designers</h3>
<p>Zen Cart&reg; gives web designers a robust and customizable electronic storefront that's easy to keep up-to-date with new features. It provides usable, intuitive and unobtrusive purchase flows right out of the box based on proven industry best-practices.</p>
<p>One of the secrets behind its power lies in our robust template system that "abstracts" the look-and-feel from the code and logic behind the scenes. This enables you to give clients a truly custom solution that integrates quickly and perfectly with their existing website design.</p>
<h3>For Developers and Hosting Providers</h3>
<p>Developers are able to deploy cutting edge solutions based on Zen Cart&reg;'s modern standards and technologies. Combining PHP server-side technology with the ability to choose from multiple databases on the back end, Zen Cart&reg; is flexible software that you can customize and modify to suit your needs. </p>
