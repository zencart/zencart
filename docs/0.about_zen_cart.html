        <h1>What is Zen Cart&reg;?</h1>
        <h2>Designed for Online Merchants</h2>
        <p>
            Zen Cart&reg; truly is <em>the art of E-Commerce;</em> a free, user-friendly, open source shopping cart system. The software has been developed and kept updated by group of like-minded shop owners, programmers, designers, and consultants that think E-Commerce could be and should be done differently. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some "solutions" seem to be complicated programming exercises instead of responding to users' needs, Zen Cart&reg; puts merchant and shopper requirements first.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, other programs are nearly impossible to install and use without an IT degree, while Zen Cart&reg; can be installed and setup by anyone with the most basic computer skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Others are so expensive. Not Zen Cart&reg; ... it is <em>FREE!</em>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Designed for Online Shoppers</h2>
        <p>
            Zen Cart&reg; is the first Open Source Ecommerce platform to attain PA-DSS certification.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zen Cart&reg; delivers the ultimate online shopping experience to your customers. Navigating through your merchandise offerings is a breeze with Zen Cart&reg;.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program allows you to draw attention to products such as "featured" and "specials" etc in addition to the traditional category/product navigation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a product is added to the shopping cart, secure checkout is a simple 3-Step process including collecting address information, shipping selection (multiple shipping methods including real-time internet shipping quotes are built-in), payment selection (<em>PayPal&trade; and AuthorizeNet&trade;</em> are just two of the various included modules) and confirming the final order including taxes and discounts/coupons/sales/gift-certificates applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are immediately notified of the order and your customer automatically receives an e-mail confirmation.</p>
        <p>
            The goals of Zen Cart&reg; include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>make the program easy to set up</li>
            <li>make it easy to customize</li>
            <li>automate tasks, such as order confirmation</li>
            <li>make navigation simple </li>
            <li>built in promotions; discount coupons, gift certificates, newsletters and product notification</li>
            <li>offer single item specials and storewide discounts, including group discounts and quantity discounts</li>
            <li>built in intelligent Search Engine Optimization tools, including per-product metatag controls </li>
            <li>password protected Administration Tool</li>
            <li>support multiple languages, currencies and tax structures </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In short, Zen Cart&reg; is shopping cart software the way it should have been all along.
        </p>
        <p>
            We simply want to deliver a fast and easy to use shopping cart program that is freely available to everyone under the GNU General Public License. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Zen Cart&reg; development team encourages feedback and contributions from the community and we invite open discussion about e-commerce solutions.

        <h2>Designed for Web Designers</h2>
        <p>
            Zen Cart&reg; gives web designers a robust and customizable electronic storefront that is easy to keep up-to-date with new features. It provides usable, intuitive and unobtrusive purchase flows right out of the box based on proven industry best-practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the secrets behind its power lies in our robust template system that "abstracts" the look-and-feel from the code and logic behind the scenes. This enables you to give clients a truly custom solution that integrates quickly and perfectly with their existing website design.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Designed for Developers and Hosting Providers</h2>
