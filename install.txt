Zen Cart(R) - The Art of E-Commerce

Welcome to Zen Cart(R) E-Commerce

THE FOLLOWING IS A VERY SIMPLIFIED INSTALLATION DOCUMENT.
WE SUGGEST YOU USE THE HTML VERSIONS IN THE /docs FOLDER FOR MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS.

THE README DOCUMENTS ARE IN THE /docs FOLDER OF THIS DISTRIBUTION.


You can find online documentation at: http://tutorials.zen-cart.com


Zen Cart has a built-in automatic installation system. However to use this you must first unpack and upload the code to a compatible web server:

1. Extract the Zen Cart ZIP file (and tell the unzip utility to *retain* folder structures)
2. Upload the Zen Cart files and folders to your server using your FTP program
3. You must make some folders writable. The details are in the HTML-formatted documentation in the /docs/ folder
4. In your browser enter the URL to your website where you uploaded the files, specifically to the /zc_install/index.php file.
5. Follow the instructions. You must create your MySQL database credentials before installation, and provide those details when prompted.

For more detailed installation instructions, please see the /docs/1.readme_installation.html document in this distribution.
