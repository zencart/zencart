## Guidelines
When submitting bug reports, issues, plugins, or code as pull requests, please adhere to the following guidelines:

* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Each suggestion/report/pull-request should be separate. Don't mix multiple issues into one. See our [git workflow](https://docs.zen-cart.com/dev/contributing/github_workflow/) for details.
* Code submissions should comply with the [Coding Standards](https://docs.zen-cart.com/dev/contributing/coding_standards/).
* If reporting a bug/issue, please provide exact steps which one can take to recreate the bug, starting from a brand new fresh install. See [Guidelines for Reporting Bugs](https://docs.zen-cart.com/dev/contributing/issues/).
* If providing a suggestion, please also **explain the business problem the suggestion will solve**.
* If publishing a plugin, be sure it complies with the [Plugin Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.zen-cart.com/dev/plugins/rules/)
* Check your spelling and grammar.

Thank you for your contributions!
